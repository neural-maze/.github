## Welcome to The Neural Maze 👋

My idea with this GitHub organisation is to collect all the code related to:

1️⃣ The YouTube Channel (subscribe if you haven't already!! 😤)

2️⃣ The website (some of the articles may involve coding ... 😁)

3️⃣ Random but interesting projects I come up with 😎


And, that would be all! Remember that you can follow me on these channels:

Youtube 👉 https://www.youtube.com/@TheNeuralMaze
Twitter 👉 https://twitter.com/MTrofficus
LinkedIn 👉 https://www.linkedin.com/in/moteropedrido/

If you have any questions or have an idea for a project that would be cool to implement, you can write to me at The Neural Maze email address: theneuralmaze@gmail.com



Happy coding! 👨‍💻👩‍💻
