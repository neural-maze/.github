## Welcome to The Neural Maze ðŸ‘‹

My idea with this GitHub organisation is to collect all the code related to:

1. My YouTube channel (subscribe if you haven't already!!) 2.

2. My blog 

3. Interesting projects I come up with ...

And, that would be all! Remember that you can follow me on these channels:

Youtube: 
Twitter: ...
LinkedIn: ...

If you have any questions or have an idea for a project that would be cool to implement, you can write to me at The Neural Maze email address! 


Happy coding!
